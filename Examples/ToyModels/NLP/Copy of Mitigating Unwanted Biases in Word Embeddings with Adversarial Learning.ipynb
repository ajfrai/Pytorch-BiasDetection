Several strong methods have been developed for learning embeddings.  One example is the [Skipgram](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/misc/proceedings/lrec-2006/pdf/357_pdf.pdf) algorithm.  In that algorithm the surrounding context is used to predict the presence of a word.  Unfortunately, much real world textual data has subtle bias that machine learning algorithms will implicitly include in the embeddings created from that data.  This bias can be illustrated by performing a word analogy task using the learned embeddings.\n","\n","It is worth noting that the usages of terms like _fair_ and _bias_ are used in this notebook in the context of a particular definition of fairness sometimes referred to as \"Demographic Parity\" or \"Equality of Outcomes\" ([Hardt et. al 2016](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6373-equality-of-opportunity-in-supervised-learning)).  This definition of fairness effectively says that any relationship at all between a variable of interest and a _protected variable_ is an example of unwanted bias.  Other definitions of fairness such as \"Equality of Odds\" can be employed when there is believed to be some form of proper relationship between the variable of interest and the protected variable.  However, all uses of _fair_ and _bias_ here should be interpreted in the context of \"Demographic Parity\".\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"G50xVJvB92z9"},"source":["First, we'll import all the packages that we'll need."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"gOrI3fGc87cz","colab":{}},"source":["!pip install -U gensim~=3.2.0\n","import gensim\n","import gzip\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","!pip install --upgrade-strategy=only-if-needed tensorflow~=1.6.0rc0\n","import tensorflow as tf"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"xS2yD-bQIdJp"},"source":["First let's copy the required data files from Google Cloud Storage to a local directory.\n","\n","To do this we'll first need to authenticate to Google Cloud Storage.

If that were the case then knowing $Y$ would not help you predict $Z$ any better than chance.  This principle can be directly translated into two networks in series as illustrated below.  The first attempts to predict $Y$ using $X$ as input.  The second attempts to use the predicted value of $Y$ to predict $Z$.  See Figure 1 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07593.pdf).\n","\n","However, simply training the weights in W based on $\\nabla_WL_1$ and the weights in $U$ based on $\\nabla_UL_2$ won’t actually achieve an unbiased model.  In order to do that you need to incorporate into $W$’s update function the concept that $U$ should be no better than chance at predicting $Z$.  The way that you can achieve that is analogous to how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) ([Goodfellow et al. 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets)) train their generators.\n","\n","In addition to $\\nabla_WL_1$ you incorporate the negation of $\\nabla_WL_2$ into $W$’s update function.  However, it’s possible that $\\nabla_WL_1$ is changing $W$ in a way which will improve accuracy by using the biased information you are trying to protect.  In order to avoid that you also incorporate a term which removes that component of $\\nabla_WL_1$ by projecting it onto $\\nabla_WL_2$.  Once you’ve incorporated those two terms, the update function for $W$ becomes:\n","\n","\n","$\\nabla_WL_1-proj_{(\\nabla_WL_2)}\\nabla_WL_1 - \\nabla_WL_2$\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"kwfqHFzAKgiV"},"source":["### Defining the Protected Variable of Embeddings\n","\n","The description of how to incorporate adversarial networks into machine learned models above is very generic because the technique is generally applicable for any type of systems which can be described in terms of input $X$ being predictive of $Y$ but potentially containing information about a protected variable $Z$.  So long as you can construct the relevant update functions you can apply this technique.  However, that doesn’t tell you much about the nature of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.  In the case of the word analogies task above, $X = B + C - A$ and $Y = D$.  Figuring out what $Z$ should be is a little bit trickier though.  For that we can look to a paper by [Bulokbasi et. al.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6227-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings) where they developed an unsupervised methodology for removing gendered semantics from word embeddings.\n","\n","The first step is to select pairs of words which are relevant to the type of bias you are trying to remove.

They are touchy, and if touched the wrong way, they blow up VERY quickly. One must be very careful to train both models slowly enough, so that the parameters in the models do not diverge. In practice, this usually entails significantly lowering the step size of both the classifier and the adversary. It is also probably beneficial to initialize the parameters of the adversary to be extremely small, to ensure that the classifier does not overfit against a particular (sub-optimal) adversary (such overfitting can very quickly cause divergence!).  It is also possible that if the classifier is too good at hiding the protected variable from the adversary then the adversary will impose updates that diverge in an effort to improve its performance.  The solution to that can sometimes be to actually increase the adversary’s learning rate to prevent divergence (something almost unheard of in most learning systems).

By trying to hide a protected variable from an adversary, a machine learned system can reduce the amount of biased information about that protected variable implicit in the system.  In addition to the specific method demonstrated here there are many variations on this theme which can be used to achieve different degrees and types of debiasing.  For example, you could debias with respect to more than one principle component of the protected variable by having the adverary predict multiple projections.  Many other elaborations on this basic idea are possible and hopefully this relatively simple system can serve as the basis for more complex and sophisticated systems capable of achieving subtle types of bias mitigation in many applications."]}]}
