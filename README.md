# Project Description

This is a project for the PyTorch Summer Hackathon. Our goal is to create a Webform / API where Pytorch users can submit models and some small amount of additional information. It returns the results of tests determining whether or not the submitted model discriminates on the basis of sex, race, or some other feature.
